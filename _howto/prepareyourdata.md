# How To Prepare Your Data 

Below are a few simple steps to help you properly prepare your transcripts for compatible use with Oral Histories As Data.

## Step 1: Getting Your Transcript Ready for Excel or Google Sheets

- Compile your oral data into a cohesive file, a word doc or a .txt file will do just fine. 
- Make sure you have organized the transcript by timestamp, speaker, and words. 
- Then click this [link](https://jhy.io/tools/convert-word-to-plain-text){:target="_blank"} to clean up your text and get it ready for your spreadsheet. 

## Step 2: Creating Your .csv 

- You will need to copy your text into a spreadsheet now. Here is a [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWrPMItiP-XOSkm7gyC8b9bl3tpSQRj9zLzS5y8QnW0/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} to help you get started. You'll see that the top of the spreadsheet is divided into sections: timestamp, speaker, words, and tags. 
- Before you copy and paste your text into the spreadsheet, you'll need to make a copy of this spreadsheet. This is easy enough, just go to the "file" tab at the top and select "make a copy". This should create an identical, editable, document in a new window. 
- Now go ahead and copy and paste the text into the spreadsheet from your word doc or .txt file. When doing this you should copy and paste the transcript after selecting the cell directly below the "speaker" cell. 
- Once you have pasted this into the spreadsheet you will see that your timestamps need to be moved over. This will be the most labor intensive part of this process. Just hover your mouse over the timestamp until your cursor turns into a white glove and then pull the timestamp over into the correct column, under the word "timestamp".
- Now add subjects in the cells under the "tags" column. 
- Finally, go up to the "file" tab at the top of your sheet and hover over "download" and select "comma-separated values" This will save your file as a .csv file, ready to be imported to your data folder on your Github or your text editor. 

## Step 3: Creating Your "filters.csv" 

- First, go to this blank [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPU-7LFZrIWcLiHuTqnlbnRD1869SJalJ5OCL7tGtzE/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"}. Then you will need to make a copy of it. Like before, click the "file" icon and choose "make a copy." This will open a new spreadsheet in a new tab. 
- You will see two fields: one says "shortfilter", the other says "text". Under shortfilter you will write out the subjects you wish you include in your transcript's .csv. Then under text you will write out a brief description of the subject tag. 
- Finally, you create a new .csv by clicking on the "file" icon, hovering above "download", and selecting "comma-seperated values".
