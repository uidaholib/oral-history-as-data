,SS:,So these are the questions?,,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah, these are the questions and it's pretty open-ended. There are sort of a couple of parts to it. The first part is the very sort of meant to be quickly going through your current practices for your digital files. It's a survey that I've done online with a bunch of emerging writers, and that I'm asking all the participants in this as well, and then we'll talk kind of specifically about your writing processes for probably the majority. There are questions about computing and computers. Usually we cover those, but sometimes, I go through those a little bit too if we have gone through those things and I want to ask a few more. Does that sound okay? Do you have to go somewhere or anything? Everyone has been an hour and fifteen to an hour and forty-five, right in there. So if you would please state for the recording devices your name and our location.",,,,,
,SS:,"It's Stephanie Strickland, New York City.",,,,,
,DB:,"Okay. In this section, I ask what you write and what you use to write it. This is about how you compose currently. What genres do you write in?",,,,,
,SS:,"I do books of poetry and I write critical essays, and I write&#8212;I make&#8212;usually collaboratively born digital works.",,,,,
,DB:,Okay. Would you say you have a primary genre?,,,,,
,SS:,Poetry.,,,,,
,DB:,What kind of devices do you own or have access to for your writing?,,,,,
,SS:,"Pens, pencils. There's four computing devices in this one room. I keep an old XP Machine going&#8212;with difficulty, these days. I liked Word 2003. I managed to get that and Word 2007 on that machine, and then I have a little small Acer, which is underneath there, which is actually probably the most advanced, but again, it's Word 2007 is on there that I write with, and it's for travel. And then since the last thing I made was an app for iPad, I was forced to buy an iPad&#8212;I had to show the thing on it!  So that's over there, a mini.",devices,,,,

[00:03:09],SS:,"Well, if I'm generating new material, I will certainly do a certain amount of writing by hand. I capture, at various points, the material in a Word processing program.

,DB:,What do you mean by that?,,,,,
,SS:,"Well, if you're writing something long with a complex argument, I think it's much easier to read and have it in front of you on paper and read it out, because it's very easy to go into a ""collage-y"" kind of style with stuff that's going to be published online. It's harder to get a really consecutive&#8212;long, consecutive argument made, I think, or a thought, and it's not fluid enough to do poetry. I mean, it restricts you way too much in terms of formatting compared to what you can do on a page by hand in terms of how you want to scratch things out or put something right in&#8212;",paper;printdig,,,,
[00:05:00],SS:,"there's no arrow, insert, none of that. So it's neither&#8212;so there's a loss from both perspectives, but obviously from the point of organizing it and sharing it and necessarily sending it on for publishing these days and everything, it has to be done in&#8212;yeah. Long, long ago, I get used to doing that. It took me a long time to get there, though, because I started on a manual typewriter and then getting an IBM typewriter was a big thing, you know.",paper; early,,300,,300

That was like this huge thing that you could erase with an erase thing, that you don't have to pull the page out and start all over again. On the other hand, there was a discipline about that.

And then came the time when I decided I needed to use the back of everything, for ecological reasons. I really feel sorry for the people that do [study this later], because now there's a version of a thing and you look on the back and you have no idea what that thing on the back&#8212;I mean, if you think of writing backward on it at the same time, they never were.",paper; future;highlight,,,,

,DB:,"It sounds like you kind of write&#8212;in Dragon Logic, it isn't really individual works, it is a collection but it's also kind of, you know&#8212;and some of your other books as well&#8212;are not quite made of individual works, but then when you're working, when you move stuff over to the computer, do you&#8212;",mss,,,,

,SS:,"&#8212; so that the structure is often what I see. Do you know? It resonates, there's some kind of resonance here. So I see that and then it becomes what's the best way in, but that's for print because then in a digital work, there's not an ""in"" in the same way, right? In other words, there's an access often to all parts of it at once, you know in some kinds though I generally provide a default path through as well as more open thing. So I think that's probably why that kind of work was something is interesting to me, starting with True North, which has those five intricately [related] poems&#8212;the True North poems are sort of used to divide up the book&#8212;but really, they are supposed to be at the center of a moving pole, like the sun going around, so...how do you tell where True North is?

,SS:,"Well, at some point it's the name of the poem, or it's a name that references the name of the poem. For a long time, I will do revisions within that file with the date at the top of what&#8212;of which revision that is. Though, sometimes when I'm doing many, many revisions in one day, that gets a little lost. Then, at the point of a manuscript, there's a whole file that's an entire manuscript and those will have dates or something, you know, called ""1, 2, 3,"" or something.

,SS:,"I did, and I'm sure seeing my father build things and stuff all the time was like&#8212;it was just more&#8212;I don't know. And I don't know why that would particularly apply but I have helped lots of people put manuscripts together. I mean, if I see a whole bunch of poems, I just&#8212;some people have a sense for that particular thing and some other people are different; their best thing is at the poem level or at some other level, critical level or whatever, but the place that I seem to operate pretty well is that putting the structure together thing.",mss;highlight,,,,
,DB:,What do you see at that level? What are you after?,mss;highlight,,,,
,SS:,"I don't know. It's just&#8212;I hear something as well as see something. Online it's often a visual thing, but in the manuscript it's like there's this leading tone&#8212;like, ""How are we going to get in, what's going to lead to this?"" and ""Do not bore me by putting this next to this because I don't&#8212;""",mss;highlight,,,,

,SS:,"No, not really, because that's not often what's the best&#8212;I've done&#8212;I mean, as an editor it's part of the whole process:  ""What is this manuscript really about? What does it really do better than anything else at the heart of it?""  That has to come out. So how do you introduce the person to that&#8212;the reader? And then how do you complicate it in an interesting way, and how do you pace it so that the person&#8212;it's like a reading pace, right?",mss;revision;highlight,,,,
,DB:,"Right, right.",,,,,

,SS:,"I don't know if I revise towards a sound but I certainly read it out loud. It's certainly not just a visual thing. It may be conceptual, but it's not conceptual without reference to the other sensory modalities. So for sure it has to read right&#8212;in my mouth.",revision,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah, in your mouth. And has that been, like, the case ever since you started?",,,,,

[01:04:12],SS:,"Well, the thing is&#8212;when I was first reading Simone Weil I was very upset about the way people responded to her, because either they couldn't stand her religious side or they couldn't stand her political side, and they would name the other one as the whatever&#8212;you know&#8212;",mss,,3852,,3852
,DB:,Right.,,,,,
,SS:,"No one would see her as like one person&#8212;that one person could have these sides, and she could come from that. And I read The Visions of Simone Machard&#8212;Brecht's play?&#8212;I think it's the best work that has been done about her ,as a fiction work. There were some other plays and things about her that I thought were unbearably reductionist.",mss,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
[01:05:00],SS:,"So I did not want that, and so from that point of view I wanted a lot of materials. You know&#8212;some documentary materials, I wanted to cover certain things, and I wanted to use her language. So pretty much, stuff was named the way it was. But then, from that point of view&#8212;of how are you going to put them together&#8212;it was exactly the fact that there were so many people who had so many different takes on it. So yes, it's almost indexical because&#8212;and this was a consideration wherever you started&#8212;I wanted you to be able to start anywhere.",mss,,3900,,3900

It's written so you can make sense of it from wherever you start. You'll have a different impression depending on where you start, and that was part of the point, right? But I think most people will read it straight through. Part of the point was like it's just impossible the number&#8212;and again, this is seeing things in the round sort of, that you read and read and read, or you have people who are supposedly sympathetic like Robert Coles, you know? Which in his own way was just most reductive of all.",mss,,,,

All these people have too many irons in the fire, right? So I wanted to tell it the way I read it from the document&#8212;I tried to keep it as accurate as far as I was able to. I mean, I didn't make stuff up. In fact, after I'd done it in the year&#8212;year and a half, whatever&#8212;of our putting it together and I stopped reading about her, you know? And I'm like, ""Somebody's going to publish some book that completely overturns this whole thing. They'll find out that whatever, this and that..."" Right? That didn't happen actually, but I did have that worry for a while: ""Let me go out and read all these other books&#8212;""",mss,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"So and I didn't feel it was bad. But what I also realized was, like, I could get out a lot of things, but I couldn't really get at her thinking. So you have more of that in Losing L'una.",mss,,,,

[01:25:08],SS:,"I have one very dear friend, Nancy Knutson who had been in the program with me, she also wrote fiction, and for a long time, every Sunday morning she was in&#8212;she moved to New Mexico&#8212;we'd call each other up and talk about poems back and forth. Rachel Loden is another person that at times we'd exchange work. She's doing different kind of work now, so&#8212;",correspondence,,5108,,5108
,DB:,Yeah.,correspondence,,,,
,SS:,"It's been a long time. Sometimes I send some stuff to Denise Duhamel who is also a dear friend, but mostly, after it's almost sort of done.",correspondence,,,,
,DB:,"Very close, okay.",correspondence,,,,
,SS:,"Yeah. So then, I have a friend in Ireland&#8212;I have friends that I correspond with but not in the sense of sending poems, which used to be in paper letters and now it's been mainly supplanted by e-mail.",correspondence,,,,
,DB:,Yeah. And has that changed&#8212;has that made any difference to you?,correspondence;change,,,,
,SS:,It hasn't made a difference in the friendships.,correspondence;change,,,,
,DB:,Right.,,,,,
,SS:,"And the thing about the poems is that&#8212;you see, some people get Give the Body Back, and The Red Virgin, and so on, and then they're just not going to get parts of Dragon Logic and there's an even stronger divide amongst people who just don't get, and they don't want to get, electronic or born-digital literature.",software;change,,,,
,DB:,"Right, right.",software;change,,,,
,SS:,"And I'm pretty much really deeply in both worlds, and they just don't get it. I mean they don't get each other and it's very hard with e-literature because it changes so much that unless you're deeply in it, it's hard to learn it. You know what I mean? It takes a lot. Of all the things&#8212;so if you're not already in the middle of a ""net kind of life""&#8212;which, the younger you are, you are, right?",software;change,,,,
,DB:,Right.,,,,,
,SS:,So it's like I talk to lots of young [people]&#8212;,,,,,
,DB:,Yeah. That's great!,,,,,
,SS:,"But my old [friends]&#8212;you know what I mean? There's like this sharp division, right?",,,,,
,DB:,Right.,,,,,
[01:27:27],SS:,"So it's not like you can really ask of these&#8212;have both these things that are in your mind&#8212;there are not so many people you can go to, because they're not going to get half of it, one way or another, right?",correspondence,,5247,,5247
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"Though I think that the younger people do get it much more. I mean, I feel like they and I are living in the same world more than&#8212;although, I do not have a cell phone, and I must be the only person that anybody knows (or very close to the only person anybody knows) who doesn't have a cell phone, and I get a lot of flak for it. But I just&#8212;there are some things I just take a stand against. The social media thing, I understand there are some uses for it, but insofar as these people&#8212;insofar as parents holding their children's hands or pushing a carriage are not responding to that child's face?",,,,,
,DB:,"It happens, I know. I know.",,,,,
,SS:,That bothers me.,,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,So I think that the way that face-to-face is cut off by the use of social media? I mean two people go to a restaurant and look at their phones? You know?,,,,,
,DB:,I know.,,,,,
,SS:,That seems a real loss to me.,,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah. It's very pronounced in New York City. I mean, I've been noticing it&#8212;I've only been here a day and I've been noticing it way more than I do out West, but I don't know. Also, I see a lot less people.",,,,,
,SS:,"Yeah, right, right, right.",,,,,
,DB:,"So, I just have a few more questions, and these are kind of about&#8212;not feeling, I guess, but&#8212;do you have, in terms of the media and the files that you've saved and created over the years, do you have sort of dear feelings towards those? I mean, what is the work? I guess, is the question. Where is it? And what do you feel protective of, or do you feel protective of anything?",,,,,
,SS:,"Well, you're glad for books. Books are going to last longer than almost anything else, in the last 20 years.",printdig,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"I love books. I do love books. I really strongly feel the limitations insofar as being a creative writer, because I do have some kind of a three-dimensional vision or hope or wish and I see it in digital art and I see it in lots of projects. And they can easily be literary to me, and they're not.",printdig,,,,
[01:30:00],DB:,Yeah.,,,5400,,5400
,SS:,"But I would never not want books. You could see that. The minute you start to do digital work, there's a certain way&#8212;in the same way that, if you're a theater person&#8212;that you have to let something go. Even more than you let a manuscript go. Today's performance was today's performance, and that won't come back. Even if you videotaped it, it really doesn't come back. That's what, you know, plus, videotape does not&#8212;so there's something like that: when you realize, and then you realize that in fact, no one may ever read it the way you meant it to be read because, at least for my generation, everybody made their own interface, there was no time to get canonical interfaces for various kinds of work or, you know, genres didn't precipitate out&#8212;there's not enough for all that. So there's a certain loss there, right?",printdig,,,,
[01:31:02],SS:,"I have no idea. I think that the best way probably at the moment to save digital stuff is to have some video or something of somebody using it, plus people's notes, interview them about what they intended or whatever, save the code if you can, and adding emulation migration. All of it is so burdensome, you know? It's really hard. On the other hand, I do send some email. There are a few folders that I've designated to go to Duke. I definitely don't want all my email to go to Duke, right? But it's very&#8212;because you don't even know&#8212;I mean, I also purge my email. Not that that does any good; but like I don't save, you know, but so I try to just keep working&#8212;only working stuff, and if it's done, it's gone. Now I pay a price for that sometimes because I might want to go back and look at it, you know, but on balance&#8212;like file maintenance is huge, and I want to be able to find what I need. You see, I do a lot of different things. So to find what I need is already a problem. So I don't want tons and tons and tons of stuff around and I'm not like those, you know, got to document every day of their life and their dry cleaning ticket and everything, I'm like, ""Christ!""  So I don't want that.",future,,5462,,5462
,SS:,"I would hope that there's some place or memory or some collection&#8212;some server somewhere&#8212;that some of this stuff can be seen and saved in some form. This whole idea, the signup kind of erase history altogether, and like&#8212;what is history? We're just nothing but a moving front. I think that's a huge loss, and I think&#8212;I'm not invested in people saving every revision. I'm not. Do you know? In some cases it might be interesting to see some of the things, but basically, the books&#8212;",future,,,,

Yeah, it could have gone another, whatever&#8212;but it didn't. And I'm not saying the right thing turned out or anything. I think I've said ""opportunistic"" to you a lot. But I think you can way overdo it, and on the other hand, I'm not like, ""whatever""...you know? I am invested to a degree. I don't think you could ever work in a library and not feel that way&#8212;",future,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"&#8212;and especially these things that got saved that nobody wanted at that time, and later you were so glad to find out that somebody saved? I really appreciate that about libraries, too. So people who want to do that kind of work, I really honor that.",future,,,,
,DB:,"Last question: when you send stuff to Duke, like when you're sending digital stuff, how does that work?",,,,,
,SS:,"Well, there's a digital librarian&#8212;this guy.",,,,,
,DB:,This guy!,,,,,
,SS:,"They both changed! Unfortunately, Willis is leaving to go to the Newberry, so the two guys I worked with so far&#8212;first the digital one left, and now Willis has left, he's the other one&#8212;but they've been replaced, right? So once a year I tell him which email files, right? And they go to do the email files. And they have my&#8212;I mean, they have the stuff online.",future,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah, so they have archived that themselves.",,,,,
[01:35:00],SS:,"Yeah, they archived that themselves. And then I don't do a&#8212;I put a lot of stuff in a box. I sort of try to include a paper that says very roughly what's in there. But I can't&#8212;to do&#8212;to really go through and catalogue the stuff, or something, it's like it's that or see my grandchildren, or do my work, you know?

,DB:,Somebody else will do that.,,,,,
,SS:,"It's like, I try to give a little bit of an indication, but it's not wonderful. But anyway, I haven't sent it off for a while. I was good for a while, I sent a lot of stuff out, but getting the two books out and the things out, you get a little lull from that to then send the stuff. The online stuff is really accessible in a lot of ways, actually, and my website&#8212;which has kind of stayed up in its form for a really long time. Again, I think the design was good.",future; printdig,,,,
