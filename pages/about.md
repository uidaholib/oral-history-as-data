# About {{site.title}}

The Oral History as Data (OHD) tool is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcripts collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included. 

Use this template site and the demo files included as examples for your own data/transcripts and then delete them. You can then delete this text and write your own about page for your project, using markdown 

Detailed How To instructions can be found on [the project website](https://uidaholib.github.io/oral-history-as-data/).
