"Initial drafting, from notebook to iPad.",paper;between,"Well, actually, I probably work primarily in this old school device called ""notebook"" where I, you know, fill pages with illegible text, and then once I start to think that my text is coming together, very often I'll do a version of it&#8212;just type it into the iPad. "
Only some files get saved--others get saved over. ,files;between;future,"I mostly save over, which is not a good idea. But sometimes I have printed out drafts, and I save drafts. I probably do not save all of them, which is not great, but I save a number of them and then eventually, I'll probably give them to the library."
Thesis binders are a time-honored tool for printed-out poems and experiments in manuscript structure.,mss;paper,"So, this is really old school. But the way I use it is, it helps me order&#8212;not only keep the poems for the manuscript, but I order the manuscript this way. I mean, I kind of decide what reads well by trying the poems out in different places&#8212;"
One project at a time yields stronger focus towards completed manuscripts.,mss;revision,"Almost never. I'm kind of, you know, obsessive when I start something. I just work on it until I finish it. I mean, once in a while I give up on something for a while and set it aside, and go on to something else, and then go back to it. But I'm not actively working on two things at a time."
"Producing more poems loosens up the manuscript design process, and allows conversant work to rise to the top.",mss,"I'm writing more now. So, I get to make some more choices&#8212;I get to cut things&#8212;cut a manuscript down, save some things for later. So, I get to make some decisions about how the poems work with each other and it's kind of intuitive."
"A tradition of sharing work with fellow writers began on paper back in the 1970s, and continues today via email. ",correspondence;career,"So, I had lengthy correspondences actually on paper with the people back in San Francisco&#8212;not all of them but some of them. I can't believe it now, how much time we spent writing long letters out by hand, or typing them on typewriters."
"Compared to typewriters, digital tools fast-forward the transition from notebook page to screen. ",change;paper,"Well, I think, I always used a notebook. You know, I couldn't tell you exactly what the notebooks looked like way back then, but I always wrote by hand. I think I wrote by hand then&#8212;I'm sure I did longer, took me longer to write a poem, and it also stayed in the hand-written phase longer because back then, when you left the hand-written phase, you had to go to a typewriter. You're too young to know about typewriters, but they were enormously irritating because if you made any mistakes, you had to either start over or put whiteout on it, or you know, etcetera. And then, you would make a copy. I mean, you would print it out and if you wanted another copy, you'd have to type it again. I mean, right?"
On eavesdropping (literally or visually) to generate material.,paper;prompt,"Yeah, I mean, I often start that way&#8212;then, and still, you know. I can&#8212;just something that I hear or see, sort of peaks my interest. It could be something I read, and I'll write down a passage, or I'll write down something I overhear someone say, or even on television, I could hear something that I write down."
"Post-computer, pre-internet.",early;change,"&#8212;later, maybe. Yeah. I think I got that Selectric in the mid-80's, maybe, you know&#8212;I probably got the computer by the late-80's, and I don't think I got internet until&#8212;there wasn't internet that you could get until the early 90's, probably."
"Despite the convenience of the iPad, hard copies are still best for reading. ",printdig,"I don't like to read on the screen. I mean, I do read things on the screen, but if I'm judging a contest or something, which I sometimes do, I ask for hard copies. Or if I get them on the screen, I print them because I just don't like to read on the screen. I mean, I don't want to sit up there on a hard chair. I don't want to look at that light&#8212;"
Parallels between sped-up correspondence via email and increased productivity as a poet. ,change;correspondence;revision,"I think I did. I mean, I would type something up and send it, usually to a couple of people&#8212;two or three people&#8212;and I would get responses back. But it certainly&#8212;I mean, now we're so used to kind of this instant dialogue, instant gratification. Sometimes I think that that's, you know, maybe that's why I'm writing faster now. Really, it is the stimulation of that."
Moving from page to iPad to computer distills the drafting process. ,prompt;revision;files;between,"Well, like always, I started here and I moved it to the iPad, and then I moved it to the computer&#8212;-but I was sending&#8212;I think I start writing&#8212;usually, I write in the morning, sitting over there. And I don't want to be running up and down the stairs, so then after I'll just go, ""You know, this looks good enough to kind of type."" So, I'll type it here. And if I don't yet feel like sharing it with someone, I'll just send it to myself because that's a way of saving it."
"Feedback via email spurs faster revision, completion, and moving on to the next poem. ",change;revision;correspondence,"I mean, I'll go, ""Maybe it's not good. Maybe I should do something else."" So, you know, I think that's why I need somebody to give me a kind of endpoint and say, ""Cut it out now."""
"Writing ""to the archive"" gives added context to projects, process. ",future,"Well, I think at some point she sold her papers and I went, ""Oh, people sell their papers and they get money."" And also I would notice that she wrote letters as if she was writing for an archive. I mean, she would kind of give you the back story that you already knew, and I'm going, ""What? Who is she talking to?"" The archive!"
