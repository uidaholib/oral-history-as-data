title: How To Edit Your _config.yml File
---

When you design your website you'll need to utilize the *_config.yml* folder to help establish the working parameters of your page, the basic information that inhabits it, and the general layout your visitors interact with. 

{:.alert .alert-warning .mb-4}
NOTE: when you are navigating through the _config.yml file, you will notice lines that being with hashtags. These are "[comments](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/commenting.html)" that provide useful information about how various lines effect your page. 

### Step 1: Get into the *_config.yml folder* 

- First, find the *_config.yml* file. This is in your base directory, the one that opens when you first open the repository in github.  
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/configscreen.png" caption="image of _config.yml file found on main page of repository" alt="image of config folder" class="w-50" %}

- Once you open up the folder, you'll need to enable editing. You're going to see a pencil icon at the top, right corner of the page. Click on this to enable editing. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/edit_pencil.png" caption="" alt="image of config folder" class="w-50" %}

### Step 2: Editing your *url, baseurl*, and *repository* (URL settings)

{:.alert .alert-info}
The URL settings control how the site generator (Jekyll!) builds the urls on your web pages. These are extremely important, especially if you're going to serve this up using GitHub Pages. If you're using GitHub Pages, you'll just want to use your GitHub username and your repository's name to fill in this information.

{% include youtube/embed.html  video-id="OAl_pcWjBwk" title="Editing URL Settings" display="d-none d-md-block" %}

- First, you'll need to change your url. To do this, delete "uidaholib" from the *url* line, and replace it with your GitHub username. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/beforename.png" caption="url before edit" alt="url line in config folder before being edited" class="w-50" %}

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/aftername.png" caption="url after edit" alt="url line after editing" class="w-50" %}

- Now you'll need to edit your *baseurl*. After the forward slash you'll delete "oral-history-as-data" and type the name of your repository. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/basebefore.png" caption="baseurl line before edit" alt="image of baseurl line before edit" class="w-50" %}
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/baseafter.png" caption="baseurl line after edit" alt="image of baseurl line after edit" class="w-50" %}

- Finally, we'll edit your *repository* line. You're going to erase the text that reads "uidaholib" and replace it with your username. Then you're going to take the final piece of the line that reads "oral-history-as-data" and replace it with your repository name. 

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/beforerepos.png" caption="repository before edit" alt="repository line before editing" class="w-50" %}
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/afterrepos.png" caption="repository after edit" alt="repository line after editing" class="w-50" %}

### Step 3: Editing *title, tagline,* *and description* (site settings)

{:.alert .alert-info}
The site settings control what appears in the website's banner, both the bit title of the site and the tagline underneath it.  The description is put in the code of each page to enable people to find your site on Google or other search engines. 

{% include youtube/embed.html  video-id="gTJpfunqapQ" title="Editing Site Settings" display="d-none d-md-block" %}

- Now scroll down to the next section in this folder titled *site settings*. Go to the first line called *title* and change "Oral History (as) Data" to what ever you would like to call your site. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/beforetitle.png" caption="title before edit" alt="title line before editing" class="w-50" %} 

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/aftertitle.png" caption="title after edit" alt="title line after editing" class="w-50" %}

- Now we're going to edit the *tag line*, which is a short banner that will run across your site next to the title. You're going to replace the text next to *tagline* that says "analyze and publish coded oral history and qualitative interviews" with whatever site description you would like. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/beforetag.png" caption="tagline before edit" alt="tagline before editing" class="w-50" %}

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/aftertag.png" caption=" tagline after edit" alt="title line after editing" class="w-50" %}


## Step 4: Generate Your Site

{% include youtube/embed.html  video-id="ioubbjzQ9EY" title="Generate Your Site" display="d-none d-md-block" %}

- Go to the settings button at the top right of your repository page
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/settings_button.png" caption="" alt="settings button homepage of repository" %}
- Scroll down to the "Pages" section, which is the second-to-last option on the left hand navigation menu. 
- Click "Pages" to go to the GitHub Pages options screen.
- Change source dropdown button from "none" to "main" and copy the URL they give you. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/source_button.png" caption="" alt="picture of source drop down menu" class="w-50" %}
- It will take several minutes for the new website to build, while your waiting go back to the main page and click the "edit" button on your repository page
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/edit_button.png" caption="" alt="picture of the edit button above your repository" class="w-50" %}
- Add the copied url to the website section and click "save" 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/url.png" caption="" alt="picture of save button" class="w-50" %}
- This will let you easily access the generated site whenever you come to edit the page. 
- Check out your new site by clicking on the link. Refresh if nothing shows up. Congratulations on setting up your own oral history site!

### Optional: AV settings 

{:.alert .alert-info}
OHD has the option of linking an audio or video file to your transcript, to enhance the experience for the user. It is compatible with YouTube, Vimeo, and Soundcloud. 

- First, you'll need to look at the *av_source* line. You'll see that there are a list of options: "YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud". OHD has YouTube set as the default option. But if you wish to choose a different option you can easily change it by erasing YouTube and writing either Soundcloud or Vimeo.
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/youtube.png" caption=" av_source line with default YouTube selection" alt="picture of the av_source line in folder" class="w-50" %}


- If you are using Soundcloud, you will need to include your Soundcloud ID, which can be found in the url of your Soundcloud files.  
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/soundcloud_copy.png" caption=" unedited soundcloud-id section with circle indicating where to find soundcloud id" alt="picture of soundcloud-id line with circle indicating where to find a soundcloud id on soundcloud's website" class="w-50" %}

{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/soundcloud2.png" caption="example text indicating where to place Soundcloud ID" alt="title line after editing" class="w-50" %}
