Ann Kinney jumped into bronc riding at the age of 30 after growing up on a family farm. She came out before the age of 18 and struggled with a drinking problem. She and her partner have both competed in the rodeo but, due to health reasons, have scaled back their involvement. Kinney has served as a great mentor for others interested in bronc riding.
